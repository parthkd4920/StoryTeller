# StoryTeller
A Simple little node based editor for writing and plotting stories.
This little project is under development by a person who just has an idea and knows little to nothing about coding.
Will worship any feedbacks, suggestions, collaboration or contribution I can get.

This is being made in Qt6
Main two files are node.h and nodegraphicsscene.h
widget.cpp and overviewer.h
others are just for reference or were used in the project before

The main idea is that you plot the story using nodes and connect them creating a visual chain of events. The story is the calculated
from the last node in the chain and stored in a QList which is then propagated to the OverViewer which is a QTextBrowser on the right of the window
giving you a recap of your current story.
The future versions will have the ability to save and open files as well as set and view important events.

Together we will make it a reality and hopefully people will never have to use paper and sticky notes to plot their stories and
writers will be able to collaborate on this single softwares making this the Figma/Autodesk Maya, of Writing Industry.

Small code, Big dreams.
